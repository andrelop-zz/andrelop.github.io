    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m such an old person. So much that I was becoming sick of having
to tinker with the operating system in order to do basic routine tasks.</p>

<p>What I needed was somehting which I could use for my work and home
computing needs, without having to deal too much with the hassle of
having to fix Bluetooth support, Flash video, dual-monitor setup,
codec configuration and all those crap one needs to deal with
when using Linux as a desktop operating system.</p>

<p>For a while, I used OSX. I was being the happy owner of a gorgeous
MacBook white (since 2007 until sometime last year). It was perfect for
my needs because it had everything I needed for work environment (a
working Unix-like operating system) plus a nicely and beautiful,
crap-aware end end user environment.</p>

<p>However, time went by fast and many software and operating system
updates later I realised hardware was becoming a bottleneck. Everything
became slow to use and painfulness turned out to be the standard.</p>

<p>As I was quite satisfied by the Apple experience I tried to go
shopping for a new machine from the same company. Sadly, money
doesn&rsquo;t grow on trees and Apple hardware here in Brazil is insanely
expensive.</p>

<p>My option would be to buy a PC-style laptop from one of the various
vendors and use Linux again. Guess what ? I did not wanted to suffer
from crap-unawareness again so this wasn&rsquo;s a real option.</p>

<p>What other option is out there ? Yes, Windows. I knew Windows had
all the support for all the crapiliciousness out there, plus it
could run games, something which would sometimes made me a little bit
happier than the usual.</p>

<p>Yes, OSX can run some games, but the hardware isn&rsquo;t the most indicated
for this kind of task. Besides, for something a little bit closer
to a minimally decent gaming experience under OSX one would need to
sell body parts to pay for it (Apple hardware upgrades are really
expensive and even paying for it with both of your eyes one would
still not get a good gaming platform in the end).</p>

<p>I went shopping for a replacement laptop and found one from Dell which
would give me a really good platform for both work and home/fun.
I&rsquo;ve been using it since sometime already, but I never was 100% happy
when it came to the work part of the equation.</p>

<p>For home usage it was perfect as I could play games and use all the
crap one could imagine. For work, I kept using Virtualbox VMs. It
worked, but then it wasn&rsquo;t great to keep those Windows Virtualbox
windows open (Virtualbox admin Windows AND the VM-in-use-window)
only to use a terminal emulator.</p>

<p>PuTTy, the terminal emulator for Windows, wasn&rsquo;t that great for
someone used to native Linux terminal emulators. Sometime ago a
friend of mine gave a tip about MobaXTerm, which is a on-steroids
terminal emulator with a Cygwin environment built-in (plus a lot
of other goodies).</p>

<p>It was centuries ahead of PuTTy when it comes to being productive
for sysadmin work (Linux servers) from a Windows box. Still, not
having a full Linux environment sometimes had its advantages.
MobaXterm offers a lot of plugins in order to improve the Unix
environment experience, but there&rsquo;s always things you need and
for which there&rsquo;s no plugin available.</p>

<p>What I did to solve my problem was to create a really minimal
Virtualbox VM (Debian-based, obviously), with no X and nothing
but the absolute mininum needed to do my work. This machine
is reachable via SSH from the Windows host only and MobaXterm
is configured to open a SSH connection to it using a previously
saved session.</p>

<p>Also, this minimal VM is started in headless mode so there&rsquo;s no
need for any window floating around without being useful. It
boots up automatically along Windows, without being noticed,
and sits there waiting for my SSH connection.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s being used for work and for any use of a proper Linux
environment whenever I feel the need for it. Actually, it&rsquo;s
working so well that I&rsquo;ve migrated my main blog post writing
platform to run under this VM (git and vim are the only tools
needed).</p>

<p>Works like a charm :&ndash;)</p>
