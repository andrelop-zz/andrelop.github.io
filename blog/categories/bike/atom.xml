    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I got myself a bike. At first, I thought buying the
thing would be all I needed to motivate me to got out more often and enjoy
nature.</p>

<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. It&rsquo;s been around three months since I
bought the bike but I went out biking only two times. It&rsquo;s a speed bike so
it&rsquo;s not easy to ride it anywhere.</p>

<p>I mean, an usual bike can be used anywhere; streets, trails, roads, etc, but
a speed one isn&rsquo;t much fun to ride in places others than proper bike lanes
and/or nicely maintained roads (ie, the ones not suffering from the hole
disease).</p>

<p>Even when using <a href="http://www.cptm.sp.gov.br/e_noticias/Campanhas/ciclovia_riopinheiros.asp">&ldquo;ciclofaixas&rdquo;</a>
you&rsquo;re going to get some flat tires. Actually, the two times I went out riding
I came back home with flat tires. That&rsquo;s a little bit disappointing.</p>

<p>The first time I received this &ldquo;gift&rdquo; I looked up online for tips on how
to avoid it and then got myself some <a href="http://www.biketown.com.br/produto/pecas-fita-aro-anti-furo/fita-anti-furo-para-bicicletas-speed-road-tectire-aro-700c-22mm-x-2-2mts-par-tectire-2377.mstp">prevention for flat tires</a>.
Alas, I found out that it did not prevented another flat tire to
happen.</p>

<p>I then asked a friend which seems to know more than myself about bikes
what I could do to prevent it from happening again (or at least minimize
the possibilities) and got an advice about buying <a href="http://www.biketown.com.br/produto/pecas-camara-ar/camara-de-ar-vittoria-speed-road-ultralite-700-x-19-23c-valvula-presta-51mm-vittoria-1801.mstp">better tubes</a>.</p>

<p>I know that there&rsquo;re much better tubes but I don&rsquo;t want to spend too
much money on it, since I&rsquo;m not going to go pro on this bike thing.
I just want to have a bike I can ride and not come home with flat tires
everytime I go out riding.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens next time I go out biking using these new tubes.
If there&rsquo;re better advices about this tube/flat tire thing, I&rsquo;m listening.
